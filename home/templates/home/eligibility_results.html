	<h1>Initial application is not approved</h1>
	<p>We're sorry, but after reviewing your application,
	we have determined that you are not a strong applicant for the Outreachy internship program.
	This may be due to one of two reasons:
	<ul>
		<li>You may not be eligible to be paid as a contractor of a non-profit based in the United States of America. This could be due to you not being eligible to work in all the countries you are living in during your internship, you being a legal minor (under 18), visa restrictions, U.S. sanctions programs, or U.S. export restrictions.</li>
		<li>You may have already participated in Google Summer of Code or a previous Outreachy round.</li>

	<h2>Can I contest this result?</h2>
	<p>
	The Outreachy program put full-time commitment checking place
	in order to ensure that both interns and mentors have a good experience.
	Based on our past experience, interns with full-time commitments,
	especially school time commitments, are less likely to have successful internships.
	</p>
	<p>
	In the December 2014 - March 2015 Outreachy internship round, we had 19
	interns who had classes during the majority of the internship time.
	Two interns failed, two interns had to extend their internship by 2 weeks,
	five interns had to extend their internships by 2 to 5 weeks.
	</p>
	<p>
	Consequently, there was a 37% chance that the organization, mentor, and
	intern will have a poor experience if an applicant who is full-time in
	school is accepted. A poor internship experience typically means that
	the Outreachy mentor chooses not to participate in the program again.
	</p>
	<p>
	Outreachy has had a significant drop in the number of failures and
	internship extensions since we implemented the full-time commitment
	policies.
	</p>
	<p>
	<strong>The Outreachy organizers are very firm about
		the eligibility rules around time commitment requirements.</strong>
	We cannot accept letters to excuse students from class work or late class enrollment letters.
	We cannot accept manager approval for an employee to work for less than the hours in their employment contract.
	We cannot allow students from schools in the Northern Hemisphere to participate in the December to March round.
	We cannot allow students from schools in the Southern Hemisphere to participate in the May to August round.
	</p>
	<p>
	We hope your time commitments change in the future such that you
	are eligible to apply for Outreachy.
